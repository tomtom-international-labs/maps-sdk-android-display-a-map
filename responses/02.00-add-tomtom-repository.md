## Step 2: Add TomTom Maven repository

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the TomTom Maven repository into the top-level build.gradle file

1. Go to the repository's directory and checkout the `changes` branch
    ```bash
    cd lab-maps-sdk-android-display-a-map
    git checkout changes
    ```
1. In `build.gradle`, replace line 21 with the TomTom Maven repository. The TomTom Maps SDK dependencies are downloaded from there:
    ```gradle
    maven {
        url "https://maven.tomtom.com:8443/nexus/content/repositories/releases/"
    }
    ```
1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
1. After the build is successful, commit and push the change:
    ```bash
    git add build.gradle
    git commit -m "Add TomTom Maven repository to top-level build.gradle"
    git push
    ```
