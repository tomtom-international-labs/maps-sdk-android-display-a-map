## Congratulations!

Congratulations on creating your first pull request and merging it.

The next step will be about displaying a TomTom map in your application.

### :keyboard: Activity: Open a new Pull Request for the next steps

Let's create a new pull request where we will implement an activity that displays a TomTom map.

1. [Create a pull request to base `master` from `display-map` branch]({{repoUrl}}/compare/master...display-map)
2. Title your pull request `Display map`

I'll respond with next steps in the new pull request.
