# Get started

In general you have two options for using a development environment:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or
* Terminal + Gradle

For simplicity reasons this course will provide you instructions on using the
terminal and Gradle.

Apart from that you will need an Android phone so that you will be able to install
the creatd application on your own phone.

Now let's cover the pre-requisites.

## Step 1: Build the project locally

### :keyboard: Activity: Clone the repository and build the project

1. Open your terminal
1. Change directories into a location where you want to keep this project
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone {{ repoUrl }}
    ```
1. Move into the repository's directory:
    ```bash
    cd labs-maps-sdk-android-search-along-a-route
    ```
1. In your repository folder, run the following build command: `./gradlew build`. This command will download Gradle, pull dependencies, build the sample app and run some tests.

In upcoming steps you will learn how to install the app on your phone and extend the app with many more features.
