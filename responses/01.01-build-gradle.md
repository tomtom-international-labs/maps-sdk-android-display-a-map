# The Gradle build system

Android uses Gradle to automate and manage the build process.

A Gradle build consists of one or more projects. Projects can be something which should be built or something that should be done. Each project consists of tasks. A task represents a piece of work which a build performs, e.g., compile the source code or generate an APK.

## The Gradle build file - build.gradle

The top-level `build.gradle` file defines build configurations that apply to all modules in your project.
Detailed information about this file can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build#top-level).

The module-level build file is located in `app/build.gradle` and allows you to configure projects specific build settings. Detailed information about this file can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build#module-level)
