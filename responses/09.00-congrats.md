Congratulations on finishing the `TomTom Maps SDK` course.

In this course you have learned

* How to use the Gradle build system (eg. building, installing APKs)
* Adding new repositories (eg. Maven)
* Adding dependencies
* Creating a simple layout with a map fragment
* Extending the Activity so that the map will be displayed in the app
* Requesting a TomTom Maps API key and using it in the Android app

We hope you enjoyed the course and would be happy about feedback.
