## Step 2: Add TomTom SDK library dependencies

1. Go to the repository's directory and checkout the `changes` branch
    ```bash
    cd lab-maps-sdk-android-search-along-a-route
    git checkout changes
    ```
1. Open `app/build.gradle` file in your favorite text editor and replace line 35 with the following additional dependencies
    ```
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-routing:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-search:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps-ui-extensions:2.4165'
    ```
1. Build the project again:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
1. After the build is successful, commit and push these changes:
    ```bash
    git add app/build.gradle
    git commit -m "Add TomTom SDK dependencies to project specific build.gradle"
    git push origin setup
    ```
