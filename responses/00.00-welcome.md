# :wave: Welcome to the TomTom Maps SDK course!

Hello and welcome to this Learning Lab where I will walk you through creating an Android
application that helps a user find points of interest along a planned route using TomTom Maps SDK.

By the end of this course you will have an application

* that displays a map,
* where the user can plan routes
* and search for points of interest

And all these running on your Android phone :iphone:
