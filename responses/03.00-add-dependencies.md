## Step 3: Add TomTom SDK library dependencies

1. In `app/build.gradle`, replace line 35 with the following additional dependencies:
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-routing:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-search:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps-ui-extensions:2.4165'
    ```
1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
1. After the build is successful, commit and push the change:
    ```bash
    git add app/build.gradle
    git commit -m "Add TomTom SDK dependencies to module-level build.gradle"
    git push origin changes
    ```
