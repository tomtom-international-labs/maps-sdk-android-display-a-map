### :keyboard: Activity: Open a Pull Request

Let's create a new pull request for the next step where we will implement an
activity that displays a TomTom map.

1. [Create a pull request to base `master` from `changes` branch]({{repoUrl}}/compare/master...display-map)
2. Title your pull request `Changes`

I'll respond with next steps in your pull request.
