# Step 1: Build the project locally

## :keyboard: Activities

## Clone the repository and build the project

1. Open your terminal
1. Change directories into a location where you want to keep this project
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone {{ repoUrl }}
    ```
1. Move into the repository's directory:
    ```
    cd maps-sdk-android-search-along-a-route
    ```
1. In your repository folder, run the following build command: `./gradlew build`. This command will download Gradle, pull dependencies, build the sample app and run some tests.

## Add TomTom SDK dependencies to the Gradle project

1. Go to the repository's directory and checkout the `setup` branch
    ```
    cd maps-sdk-android-search-along-a-route
    git checkout setup
    ```
1. Open `app/build.gradle` file in your favorite text editor
1. Add the following dependencies into the `dependencies` block:
    ```
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-routing:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-search:2.4165'
    implementation 'com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps-ui-extensions:2.4165'
    ```
1. Build the project again:
    ```
    ./gradlew build
    ```
1. After the build is successful, commit and push these changes:
    ```
    git add app/build.gradle
    git commit -m "Add TomTom SDK dependencies to app"
    git push origin setup
    ```

In upcoming steps you will learn how to install the app on your phone and extend the app with many more features.
