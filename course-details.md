This tutorial shows how to use TomTom Maps SDK for Android and create an working application in less than 30 minutes.

## In this course you will learn:

* How to start your journey with TomTom Map SDK
* Write a simple Android Main Activity
* Connect with TomTom Web Services using [TomTom developer portal](http://developer.tomtom.com)

## Build the next generation of location experiences

In order to get a fully functional application you need to obtain a free API key
by completing the registration on [TomTom Developer Portal](
https://developer.tomtom.com/user/register).

**WARNING:** Keep in mind that the API key is personal and can't be shared nor pushed to the public repository. By doing that you would violate [terms and conditions](
